# Card RPG

**About game**

A simple card RPG where each player has initial lives set to 10, shields to 5 and mana to 10 at the beginning of the game. Before the first turn, a starting player is drawn at random. The player who does not start gets 3 extra mana as compensation. The players can use only one card per turn. However, if the player does not have enough mana, he is skipped, and it is his opponent's turn. After each turn, the player gets 2 mana and also licks another card from the deck. However, he always holds a maximum of five cards in his hand. The aim of the game is to destroy the opponent with the help of a suitable strategy and cards from the deck.

**Deck of card**

There are always at least ten cards in the deck. Each card can have up to three of the four effects available. Effects can be offensive, defensive, healing or magical. The offensive effect usually takes away the shield and / or health of the enemy, depending on its current state. The defense effect adds a shield to the player who uses the card with this effect. And the healing effect adds lives to the player. However, the magic effect is also very interesting, which adds mana to the player and can significantly affect the course of the game.
